However, be sure that you only pay a proportional amount of fees to do this. In 2019 you could purchase 0.001 bitcoin to store by yourself (avg. corresponding amount was 6 euro) by only paying a fee of a few eurocents to bitcoin miners and exchanges.

But, agreed, you have to know what you\'re doing when you purchase smaller fractions of bitcoin. We invite you to check the web for free to get a deeper understanding.

Another way to get portions of bitcoin is to ask people to pay you in bitcoin!

B. the environmental costs of energy in general. How to minimize all energy consumption to save our planet.

Almost everything we do has a negative impact on the Earth. Skilled bitcoin operators are aware of that and use renewable energy and excess electricity. However, there is always room for improvement. The greater argument is, is Bitcoin is worth the investment in energy?

We need to consider bitcoin\'s energy costs in proportion to other energy burners. For example, what about terrace heaters or christmas lights? Both of these burn more energy. 

But there is another angle to the claim that bitcoin miners use sustainable energy. For example @DigiEconomist writes: ""Cambridge [University]  once again confirmed over 60% is actually fossil fuels...; and the authors responsible for the work that concludes it’s mainly renewable energy have publicly admitted to making some \'mistakes\'.""

The bitcoin protocol has certain features of these simple schemes. However, bitcoin is the ponzi/bubble that never pops and always comes back stronger and bigger.

You can\'t really compare Bitcoin to gold or even to fiat money like the Dollar or Euro. Something like bitcoin has never existed before.  It is hard to understand that the new kid on the block, bitcoin, will eventually decrease in supply through loss. Eventually people will have to accept that bitcoin is going to go up in value against any other asset that can still be increased in supply. 
(HvC, excerpt from 21btc on Reddit Dec 2019 https://bit.ly/2suMDjj)

In a fundamental sense the Bitcoin ecosystem is an inclusive, sharing economy. The early adopters have been rewarded well, maybe too well, but where can they go with their money? They will eventually buy your products. Bitcoin has a stock to flow ratio, just like any other money, and it’s no use rich early adopters (also called \'whales\') taking their assets with them to their graves. Bitcoin will be spent one day. 
And one other good feature of bitcoin: if you lose the authoritive keys to it, everyone else in the network will benefit from that loss, which is - in a sense - very democratic.

Born and raised in Italy, he became known in the early 1920s as a swindler in North America for his money-making scheme. He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days or 100% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value as a form of arbitrage. In reality, Ponzi was paying earlier investors using the investments of later investors. While this type of fraudulent investment scheme was not originally invented by Ponzi, it became so identified with him that it now is referred to as a ""Ponzi scheme"". His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed, costing his ""investors"" $20 million.

Two other block size considerations put together by @Lickyvi, a student of the University of Nicosia MOOC 2020, are:
A. Increasing block size achieves minimal transaction throughput gain at high security cost.
After Segwit increased the block size from 1MB to 2MB in 2017, Bitcoin still only achieves <10 transactions per second but with greater pump-and-dump capability, and still has 50% fault tolerance but with greater hashrate centralization. However Layer 2 solutions like Lightning solve the problem and are being extensively used.

(https://bitcoinmagazine.com/what-is-bitcoin/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-size-limit)

B. The problem with signatures is transaction malleability:
""In particular, ECDSA which we are using for signatures, has an inherent problem namely you can, as a signer, as someone who has the private key, you can just change the signature into something else. This means that even with strong restrictions on what can be changed, you can never change, such as in 2-of-3 multisig, you cannot prevent only 1-of-3 from changing their signature. This is a form of malleability. The only people you want to construct the valid transactions are those who have that right, only for all of them. Separating signature data from the transaction completely solves this problem.""

This quote outlines a worldview where you don\'t have to be afraid of change. At present, governments have a grip on the state of mind of citizens through their strong relationship with mainstream media and the judiciary. They can educate citizens, direct them, frighten them, provide service or not, etc. 

There is a relevant counter-question embedded in the characterization of bitcoin as anarchic: is there sufficient separation of branches of the state (trias politica) and are important independent social functions such as the media, really independent in our modern capitalistic democracies?

Also, the validation of transactions can be centrally controlled. Moreover there have been patents inflicted on bitcoin. As a typical form of centralization, patents mean that a central party with a monopoly can set prices, exclude people and censor information.",2,2,1,"Being decentralized to a certain extent is one of the major building blocks related to bitcoin\'s benefit and price. Putting it more broadly, bitcoin is a platform of trust from which new uses emerge. Think of applications in areas where mistrust is involved, e.g. reselling of tickets.
","The bitcoin system has always had strong incentives to further decentralize. Therefore bitcoin is currently more decentralised than any other currency and is even more dispersed than any other store of (money-related) value, such as gold or diamonds. 

As new use cases emerge, the level of decentralization in the Bitcoin network increases. For example, excess energy from powerplants have only recently been converted to bitcoin in an economically feasible way. In this way, new players arrive and increase mining decentralization. Bitcoin rests on three design principles: immutability, self sovereignty and efficiency, the first two being the most distinctive from other technologies. Bitcoin needs to grow into a more decentralized environment, as decentralization helps to realize immutability and self-sovereignty.

With bitcoin, it is almost as if you can send value over the internet for the first time, although you are actually sending information. Since bitcoin\'s infrastructure is global, it is as if we have one large bank, fully automated and which no one - and everyone - at the same time controls. This characteristic makes the Bitcoin network extremely valuable, because it consists of a trustless digital settlement layer, which is extremely secure and not dependent on - nor can it be censored by - one particular nation or organisation.

Seven transactions per second - that can\'t be real money.,3,3,1,"Yes, Bitcoin does seven transactions per second. How does that benefit the intended use cases of bitcoin? To move a large store of value, bitcoin has proven unbeatable in safety, high speed and low fees.","Let\'s have a closer look at the two distinctive features of a bitcoin transaction: 
1. moving a store of value 
2. a medium of exchange

To move a large store of value, cryptocurrencies, e.g. bitcoin, have proven to be unbeatable in speed and fees.
Twitter account @whale_alert reports transactions of large chunks of value live. For example, a transaction of 163$M was done in an hour and for a $1 fee in 2020.

On the other hand, low value transactions carry an expectation of immediate delivery, so they need high speed networks. Bitcoin transactions can still be the means to an end, but just not as efficient for this use as expected. For high-speed, high-volume, and low-cost transactions you need Layer 2 solutions on top of Bitcoin. Layer 2 technology is available and it\'s called the Lightning Network.  Layer 2 solution projects also aim to enable cross-chain transactions (Polkadot, Cosmos, Interledger); these systems also reside on top of the blockchains of the currencies involved.

There is another group of solutions to consider. These are developments, besides bitcoin, that strive for high speed, high volume on-chain transactions (e.g. Bitcoin Cash). Why has bitcoin not simply adopted these techniques? Because it\'s always a trade-off. There is a good reason why bitcoin has just 7 transactions per second. Let\'s look at that in more detail:
\'On-chain\' means the actual settlement layer or the ledger of a cryptocurrency. However, these kinds of alternative developments need to give up at least one of the core design principles of open public blockchain, namely that anyone, anywhere, anytime should be able to participate, freely and uncensored in any way.  As soon as you give away or discard a unique core design principle of a young innovation like bitcoin, you should immediately ask yourself, \'why not go back to the solutons we\'ve already had for decades?, \'why not use a database or a bank?\'.

By the way, cash is superior to every sequential system, such as Swift for banks or a blockchain protocol for bitcoin, because it is a parallel system: it can happen concurrently any place in the world with infinite speed. From that perspective, cash reigns.","What is name of the most promising technology that enhances bitcoin\'s transaction speed?|Grasshopper Network|Mengle Tree Network|+Lightning Network|The Lightning Network is a ""Layer 2"" payment protocol that operates on top of a blockchain-based cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin).

However, it is more likely is that fees will support a fair margin of payment for miners, on top of the energy cost.","As the bitcoin subsidy gets reduced over time, fees will have to increase to pay for the security of bitcoin. Bitcoin subsidy is the reward the bitcoin miners get for a winning block of transactions. This subsidy halves roughly every 2.5 years ending in nearly nothing. The miners get paid for contributing the security of the whole bitcoin blockchain by participating in a \'winner takes it all\' game that is based on randomness. But at the same time for settling all the transactions in a block. There are diverging opinions about whether this protocol can still be successful in the future. All miners have energy costs and only one miner, or mining pool, can win roughly every ten minutes. So the bitcoin subsidy has to cover all energy costs. There are many parameters involved that influence the necessary fees to be able to keep up bitcoin security guarantees, such as the hashing power of miners, bitcoin subsidy, bitcoin difficulty, bitcoin price expressed in $,€, etc.

Apart from this security aspect there is the fee economics around the settlement of transactions. @ofirbeigel: ""Bitcoin transaction fees (sometimes referred to as mining fees) allow users to prioritize their transaction over others and get included faster into Bitcoin’s ledger of transactions known as the blockchain.

An estimate from January 2018 concludes that the Bitcoin network consumed on average 2100 MW or 18,40 TWh/year (Brevand 2017). The latest data from May 2018 states at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity consumption (De Vries 2018). In contrast, a real-time energy consumption index from Cambridge University assumes a range between 31Tw/h and 68 TW/h (CBECI 2019). 

These numbers sound shocking compared to a country like Iceland, which uses as much as 18.1 TWh/year. As a comparison, the energy demand of all existing data centres is assumed to be as high as 200 TW/h (Andrae & Edler 2015).""

It is hard to control how people use energy. Everyone does things with energy that others think are a waste. And it is difficult to convince people to spend on sustainable energy that costs more. But Bitcoin actually provides an answer to some energy issues. The costs of transporting electricity generated in one place to another are high, often so high that it\'s not worth the effort. 

Bitcoin solves that issue by transporting the resulting money value effortlessly to any place in the world. Supporters of bitcoin argue that instead of their opponents criticising people for spending energy on Bitcoin, maybe these bitcoin opponents could come up with more interesting and better ways to spend the energy than on bitcoin mining. 

Experts consider it an opportunity that we have abundant sustainable energy-source available in remote places. For example excess gas that is normally wasted. Or think of solar power, wind energy or water power. We can\'t do anything useful with this energy in remote places because of the costs of storage and transport. So we either let this capacity reside or ... we convert it into bitcoin. At the same time this intrinsically (all by itself): 
 - improves the security of the bitcoin network
 - drives out unsustainable energy uses by bitcoin miners
 - drives out energy consumption that has alternative application

Bitcoin is not like gold. It is considered to be better by many observers, for example

1. Easily divisible 
2. More portable 
3. Counterfeit-resistant, which means you can\'t fake it

There is nothing on an open public blockchain that is personal information. 
If you argue that public keys should be considered as personally identifiable information, then try to answer these two questions: How can I prove who\'s behind a public key, even if it\'s my own?
How can I prove that I\'ve lost access to the public key, which is supposed to be under my control?

Public keys have a very weak connection to individuals in principle. However, with significant effort the individual can be identified. Better practise would be to only put hashes (the cryptographical digest or proof of any chunk of digital data) of public keys on a public blockchain.

","Good practise would be to only put hashes of public keys on a public blockchain. Sometimes systems add a bit of extra salt and/or extra pepper to the hashes (no kidding!)

To address the first point: motivation. Bitcoin is considered an innovative, open public, uncensorable, transnational, self sovereign platform of trust, that, to many people, is worth fighting for and has proved to be a low-risk, high return investment. If you don\'t see this, you might get so-called ""weak hands"" and sell too early or, even worse, you might get the fear of missing out (FOMO) and buy at the wrong time.

People think $100,000 bitcoin is fantasy and that there is not enough money in the world for Bitcoin to be worth millions of dollars. That assumption is incorrect. Bitcoin could even be worth $50 million dollars per coin, which would make 2 satoshi equal 1 dollar. 
(HvC, excerpt from 21btc on Reddit Dec 2019 https://bit.ly/2suMDjj)

Even if, in that situation, a bitcoin transaction costs a fee of 10 000 Satoshi (5000 US $ fee), it would not be a problem, because you don\'t need to actually perform that transfer of money on the blockchain. It could be done on second layers that are much cheaper in transaction fees in exchange for a different security level. Not all transactions need top security.

That brings us to the second point: is deep understanding needed? No, but just enough to be able to recognize benefits other than just the exchange-rate with fiat currencies like $ and € or gold.

Mining bitcoin, running a node, and using bitcoin are all voluntary activities. People can start and stop any time they like. And all the time, every single effort is enforcing the decentralised network.

For example, public keys are personal data.",1,3,1,"In the early days of blockchains (2012-2016), there were some privacy issues. Since then new decentralized identity schemes have been developed that conform to privacy rules and GDPR. These new schemes no longer reveal any personal data. ","On a healthy blockchain, there are only encrypted proofs that point to digital data in the virtual outside world. Public keys can\'t be considered personal data in general, for three reasons: 
a. It\'s either the key holder\'s decision to publish their identity (sign the key) or someone else has revealed the connection between the holder and the public key against the holder\'s will (but it takes lots of work to identify the connection of public keys to individuals),
b. No one can ever prove to be the only person to control a certain key, 
c. No one can ever prove to have lost the key. 

The GDPR regulation hasn\'t fully matured yet. Not everything is clear. Two main issues can be identified in relation to immutable ledgers such as the blockchain of bitcoin. These are: 
- the right to be forgotten
- the right of erasure (a mandatory action is attached to this).
Subjects of digital data, the people whose data is in databases, can request these rights to be executed by the data controllers. 

This is of course a challenge for an immutable ledger, like bitcoin. Moreover, it is a problem that its miners are considered to be the responsible data controllers because the GDPR may hold them accountable for something they can\'t control. How is that possible? A bitcoin address is a pseudonym, an identifier that can be bound to an identity and therefore considered to be personal identifiable information. Individuals that are identified and bound to this identifier can ask for the right to be forgotten and to be deleted.
","With regard to privacy, we might consider a public key as a password. We would only put hashes of passwords on a public blockchain, wouldn\'t we.
A salt is a bit of additional data which makes hashes significantly more difficult to crack.
 “Peppering” uses additional data to the hash function into a Message Authentication Code.
The question is what is the right statement?|+Salt is public, Pepper is a secret| Both Salt & Pepper should be kept private|Both Salt & Pepper are public nonces for the hashes| Salt is a secret extra password and Pepper is public data|
To Authenticate the hash you need a secret pepper, to create uniqueness of every hash we use public salt. Read more:

- To keep blockchains lean and mean, blockchains are replicated thousands of times on computers all over the world. If there was data on the blockchain that we did not strictly need there, it would not be very efficient.
- Security guarantees of blockchain require fast transfer of blocks globally. Small blocks are faster. 
- Privacy regulations and privacy ethics demand that people do not put personal data or data that relates to individuals on immutable data structures on the web.
- Last but not least, we\'ve had decades of database developments and we should use databases, not blockchains, to store data. Database - it\'s in the name!

It is recommended to use database technology to manage single stored data. Putting data on blockchains is insanely inefficient and dangerous. Besides this, blockchains aren\'t mature enough nor equipped to manage large chucks of digital data.

Fintech people have a related, but more technical, misconception about the small number of transaction per second the bitcoin blockchain settles. Mind you, the misconception considered here is about the user experience of a transaction.

Over time we might see more self-sovereign handling using cold storage of cryptocurrencies by their owners and using multisign schemes to mitigate the risks of putting cryptocurrencies in the hands of third parties.

The bitcoin protocol itself does not need any intermediary. It has a level playing field for roles involved: users, miners, shops, developers. Dive into the wiki page, linked below, about the \'Nash Equilibrium\'.

Without this security bitcoin indeed would be useless.","Complex calculations? No. Massive volumes of simple calculations? Yes, but this is not the reason why bitcoin uses energy. 

Bitcoin is secured by the energy put into the \'Proof-of-work\' (PoW) process.
The energy use of PoW is all about \'guessing in a fair game\'. If you participate in a setting of multiple players whereby a totally random guessing of numbers takes place, it can be considered a fair game. For example, in a game of throwing ten dice where the person who throws 10 sixes first wins, all the players have an equal chance of winning and this is a fair game. This is a simplified idea of how bitcoin mining works: the proof of work confirms the fact that you\'ve thrown the dice until you get 10 sixes and, also, did all the work to get there. The former is luck, the latter is based on statistics.

Further elaboration on the specifics of the PoW for bitcoin:
a. The energy used to do massive amounts of calculations is mainly for the very sophisticated security protocol of bitcoin. It has got very little to do with the alleged or perceived complexity of the calculations.
b. The hash*-calculation in use has very important features that we need; every single one of them is to secure the bitcoin protocol:
  1. hiding feature through one way encryption - it is practically undoable to reverse the process.
  2. verification feature - it is easy, fast and cheap to perform
  3. transparency feature - open source, immutable, auditable
  4. fair game feature - puzzle friendliness of the hashing algorithm
  5. neutrally scalable - anyone with hardware and software can join
(Other taxonomy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)
c. To decentralise the verification of transactions, bitcoin has a protocol based on automatism, called mining. Anyone can be a miner. Every miner has a chance to win the game roughly every ten minutes. He/she does so by repeatedly calculating a hash. 
To developers, miners and other bitcoin experts, the mining process doesn\'t compute anything special. It merely tries to repeatedly test a random number (also referred to as a nonce) which, in combination with the resulting hashes of the transaction set and previous block hash, results in a hash with special properties.

Whether or not bitcoin uses a ‘lot’ of energy is relative to personal opinions and also relative to other uses. Is it OK for governments and banks to burn up lots of energy with their centralised surveillances and systems of control?

Creators of so-called blockchains SAY they innovate with decentralisation, immutability and self sovereignty, but in practise 95%+ percent IS just a database. This is the reason why critics of ""blockchain bullshitters"" are extra critical of them and why we are keen on truly innovative and beneficial blockchains. 

@avanwirdum presents an analogy about what\'s going on with the smooth talk in white papers: ""It is like a magicians trick. We are in the audience. We know that the woman on stage can\'t float in the air. It\'s an illusion. But everyone around you thinks she really does. And we\'re not allowed to look closely to see how we are fooled around. Instead we have to check every single detail, every disguise, all quick manoeuvres to unravel the secret of the illusion - from a distance. That\'s what private blockchain - and ICO salesmen - do with us, create an illusion of beneficial blockchain features that their solutions actually don\'t have.""

Clear and brief answers can, and should, be given to the simple questions that distinguish meaningful blockchains from databases, and open public blockchains from private chains that are, in fact, distributed databases.

This is the basic question any blockchain-project and product should be able to answer right away (no beating around the bush):
What kind of trust have you effectively eliminated using proofing, signing and timestamping an open public blockchain by relevant roles in the process (e.g. producer, transporter, retailer). If you don\'t know, then your solution needs a database - it\'s not a blockchain.

You might have a real, interesting challenge to solve, but most probably blockchain is not the part of the answer. Use the tips above so that we can quickly verify that you\'re on the right track. Too many initiatives ignorantly or deliberately use ""blockchain"" as a marketing instrument. We need to get rid of magicians so that we can have a realistic discussion about the truly unique benefits of (open public) blockchains.",,,,"@anialexander \'s Few common lies we keep hearing about.

In many ways, answering this question is the whole point of this book: https://livebook.manning.com/book/self-sovereign-identity/. It lays out how and why SSI will affect almost everything we do on the Internet—day in and day out. Some of these changes may actually be as deep and profound as the Internet itself was in the 1980s and 1990s—and the Web was after that.

The fundamental reason is grounded in the term “self-sovereign identity”: it represents a shift in control. We started out trying to find a solution to the Internet’s missing identity layer; what we ended up discovering was that to solve those problems we needed a shift in control from the centers of the network—the many “powers that be”—to the edges of the network—where all of us exist and interact as peers.

This shift in control is wonderfully captured in this diagram from Tim Bouma, author of the chapter on Canada: Enabling Self-Sovereign Identity: https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*UIOiysZYCJyKdep-BAJFcQ.png
